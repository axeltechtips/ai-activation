# ai-activation

This part of the project uses AI code and the cmd line to generate Windows activation keys. The script will generate 100 to unlimited random Windows activation keys that are similar to working ones, and it will try each key to see if it works. If a key works, the script will activate Windows and add the key to a working_keys.txt file. If all of the keys are invalid, the script will print a message saying that no valid keys were found.


# THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY TO SEE IF AI IS POWERFUL ENOUGH FOR THIS.
# Make sure to run as administrator.
