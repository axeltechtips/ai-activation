# ai-activation

This part of the project uses AI to generate Windows activation keys. The script will generate 100 random Windows activation keys, and it will try each key to see if it works. If a key works, the script will activate Windows and add the key to a working_keys.txt file. If all of the keys are invalid, the script will print a message saying that no valid keys were found.
